Hello everybody! I am Elijah, just guy from Uzbekistan trying to become a programmer with my old android phone. 
In this repository I'm gonna upload every day python code files with things I learned with commentaries for helping other 
guys like me, so they can learn something from my codes. 

I use termux as a terminal and neovim + nvchad as a code editor. If you either want to code on phone but do'nt know how,
I can help with setting up termux, python, nvim, nvchad(for better UI) and other life savers for phone users. 
Just send mail to - abdulbosidjonbek2@yahoo.com

Feel free to teach me something you know and I don't, I'd really be happy. Hope you like it !
